## Mirta's Web

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my repo. I created this web app to present myself, show off my skills and projects I have worked on. 

This app is created by Svelte / SvelteKit, Tailwind & MongoDB. 


## Run Development

Install dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Run Build

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

## Run Tests

```bash
npm tests
```
